# ftx-async
Unofficial Rust implementation of an asynchronous Websocket and REST client for the FTX crypto exchange 

![ci](https://github.com/IanMichaelAsh/ftx-async/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

<h1>Running Integration Tests</h1>
Integration tests use environment variables to look up credentials to use to authenticate with the FTX exchange. A read-only key should be created on FTX and its details should be set into 'FTX_API_KEY' and 'FTX_SECRET' environment variables.
